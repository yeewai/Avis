#AVIS (2.0)

After learning RoR, AVIS 2.0 is a cleaner reimagining of the originally php implemented AVIS. AVIS is a project management/file manager web app created for <http://catalyticproductions.tumblr.com>, a Gaia based comic studio.

At the core of the hierarchy are project items which are essentially the comics. Within comics are categories and items such as the pages and scripts. At the moment, uploading directly to google docs is not yet implemented, but it's on the list (as soon as I can figure out how to do it...). Users can leave comments on any of these items. They can also create tasks which are notes of what needs to be done still

There are status reports so users can check in and tell us what they've been up to.
